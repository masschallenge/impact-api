# Our Vision of Inclusion

We invite participation both online and in person from all individuals regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, race, ethnicity, nationality, age, sexual orientation, personal appearance, body size, religion, disability, or other defining characteristic.

While diversity is integral to our community, differences in culture and communication styles can lead to misunderstandings.  We encourage people from all backgrounds to participate and we offer these guidelines to ensure everyone's experience is safe and welcoming.  This is not an exhaustive list of everything you should or should not do in our community, but rather a collection of suggestions to help build the type of environment that supports creativity and collaboration.  These guidelines apply to all members of this community.

This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.
